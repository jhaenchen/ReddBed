# ReddBed
Embeddable updating reddit posts for sharing and posting around the web.

ReddBed allows you to embed live reddit content in your website. It loads and updates automatically. You can embed redit posts, comments, and even subreddits incredibly easily by simply copying the TWO LINES of code required to embed. For more complex hierarchies you can use the Reddbed chrome extension to generate the entire tree of selected comments. You can contribute to the Chrome extension [here](https://github.com/jhaenchen/ReddBedExtension). You can even use the chrome extension to generate Reddit markdown comment hierarchies, to make complex conversation references easier.

Please feel free to message me on reddit or GitHub with any questions.


Thanks for checking out ReddBed!
